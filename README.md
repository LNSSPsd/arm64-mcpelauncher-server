# arm64-mcpelauncher-server

An unstable hacky Minecraft Bedrock Edition server that runs on arm64 devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi)

This launcher only supports Minecraft v1.20.81 at this point, and the configuration files might not actually work :(
but still better than QEMU bc QEMU is slow af :/

Support for latest version is to be done later

The image above shows a Minecraft server running on Raspberry Pi 4 device smoothly 
(Only terminal window ssh'd to raspi, the Minecraft window is on my x86_64 machine)
