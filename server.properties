#server-authoritative-movement=server-auth
# Allowed values: "client-auth", "server-auth", "server-auth-with-rewind"
# Enables server authoritative movement. If "server-auth", the server will replay local user input on
# the server and send down corrections when the client's position doesn't match the server's.
# If "server-auth-with-rewind" is enabled and the server sends a correction, the clients will be instructed
# to rewind time back to the correction time, apply the correction, then replay all the player's inputs since then. This results in smoother and more frequent corrections.
# Corrections will only happen if correct-player-movement is set to true.
#NI

#player-movement-score-threshold=20
# The number of incongruent time intervals needed before abnormal behavior is reported.
# Disabled by server-authoritative-movement.
#NI

#player-movement-action-direction-threshold=0.85
# The amount that the player's attack direction and look direction can differ.
# Allowed values: Any value in the range of [0, 1] where 1 means that the

# Disabled by server-authoritative-movement.

#player-movement-duration-threshold-in-ms=500

# before the abnormal movement score is incremented. This value is defined in milliseconds.

# If true, the client position will get corrected to the server position if the movement score exceeds the threshold.
#NI

# If true, the server will compute block mining operations in sync with the client so it can verify that the client should be able to break blocks when it thinks it can.
#NI

#chat-restriction=None
# Allowed values: "None", "Dropped", "Disabled"
# This represents the level of restriction applied to the chat for each player that joins the server.
# "None" is the default and represents regular free chat.
# "Dropped" means the chat messages are dropped and never sent to any client. Players receive a message to let them know the feature is disabled.
# "Disabled" means that unless the player is an operator, the chat UI does not even appear. No information is displayed to the player.
#NI

#disable-player-interaction=false
# If true, the server will inform clients that they should ignore other players when interacting with the world. This is not server authoritative.

#NI

#block-network-ids-are-hashes=true
# If true, the server will send hashed block network ID's instead of id's that start from 0 and go up.  These id's are stable and won't change regardless of other block changes.
#NI, default

#disable-persona=false
# Internal Use Only
#NI

#NI

#server-build-radius-ratio=Disabled
# Allowed values: "Disabled" or any value in range [0.0, 1.0]
# If "Disabled" the server will dynamically calculate how much of the player's view it will generate, assigning the rest to the client to build.
# Otherwise from the overridden ratio tell the server how much of the player's view to generate, disregarding client hardware capability.
# Only valid if client-side-chunk-generation-enabled is enabled
#NI

#allow-outbound-script-debugging=false
# Allows script debugger 'connect' command and script-debugger-auto-attach=connect mode.

# Allows script debugger 'listen' command and script-debugger-auto-attach=listen mode.
#NI

#force-inbound-debug-port=19144
# Locks the inbound (listen) debugger port, if not set then default 19144 will be used. Required when using script-debugger-auto-attach=listen mode.

#script-debugger-auto-attach=disabled
# Attempt to attach script debugger at level load, requires that either inbound port or connect address is set and that inbound or outbound connections are enabled.
# "disabled" will not auto attach.
# "connect" server will attempt to connect to debugger in listening mode on the specified port.
# "listen" server will listen to inbound connect attempts from debugger using connect mode on the specified port.
#NI

#script-debugger-auto-attach-connect-address=localhost:19144
# When auto attach mode is set to 'connect', use this address in the form host:port. Required for script-debugger-auto-attach=connect mode.
